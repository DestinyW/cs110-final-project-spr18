* Project Description
* User Interface Design
    * A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program.
        * For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components
        * You should also have a screenshot of your final GUI
* Program Design
    * You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python.
        * For each additional module you should include
            * url for the module documentation
            * a short description of the module
    * Decide upon a class interface for the classes in your project.
        * A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see the sample Proposal document for an example).
        * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
    * You should have a list of each of your classes with a description.
* Tasks and Responsibilities
    * You must outline the team member roles and who was responsible for each class/method, both individual and collaborative.
* Testing
    * Describe your testing strategy for your project.
* A copy of your ATP
