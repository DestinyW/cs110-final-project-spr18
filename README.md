## 1. Project Description
This game (name TBD) is a side scrolling fetch game. The player picks one of <6> dog breeds, and then has to catch frisbees. Frisbees are automatically launched across the screen and come in 5 different colors, each with a different point value (tentatively: Black = - 25, White = 0, Red = 10, Blue = 20, Green = 40). The player controls their dog with the arrow keys and uses the spacebar to jump and catch frisbees. There is <a time limit> to reach <a total number of points> per level, and <5> levels total.

## 2. User Interface Design  
#### 2.1 Main Menu/Start Screen
This screen is the first thing that the user sees. It gives the user the option to play the game by clicking "start", to leave the game by clicking "quit", or to view the instructions by clicking "instructions".

(GUI concept)

#### 2.2 Instructions Screen
This screen will display a short description of the game and show the user how to play the game. From this screen, the user will be able to play the game by clicking "continue", return to the main menu by clicking "main menu", or leave the game by clicking "quit".

(GUI concept)

#### 2.3 Breed Choice
This screen will display pictures of <6> dog breeds. Each dog would have different skill sets. Hovering the mouse over each dog shows a floating text box displaying:  
   * Strengths (ex: fast runner, etc) TBD
   * Weaknesses (ex: low jumper, etc) TBD

(GUI concept)

#### 2.4 The Game Menu
This is where gameplay takes place (rolling screen on a loop). Frisbees are launched from the right of the screen and the player will use the arrow keys to move within the field. As the ground scrolls in later levels, obstacles will appear. The player will have to use the spacebar to jump and get frisbees and clear obstacles. If the dog fails to jump over an obstacle, the dog trips and can’t move for <3> seconds. 

Possibilities of increasing difficulty: Moving obstacles that approach the dog, decreasing the time limit every level

(GUI concept)

#### 2.5 The Game Over Menu
##### 2.5.1 Failure
If the player fails to get the required number of points within the time limit they are shown a screen that says “GAME OVER!” with 3 small buttons beneath it:  Main Menu, Change Breed Choice, and Play Again

##### 2.5.2 Success
If the player completes all 5 levels they are shown a screen that says “WINNER!” and displays their score. There are also 2 buttons: Play again and Main Menu

(GUI concept)
